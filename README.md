Rectangle class checks if the x,y,h, or w values are less than 0 and if true will set them equal to 0, otherwise the input value. self.string creates a comprehensive string to properly output the x,y,h, and w values.

Surface class type casts the filname to a string and saves it to self.image. Saves the inputs values for x,y,h, and w to its repspective self. function and then uses these inputs to create self.rect which uses the aformentioned Rectangle class. It is then able to return self.rect to the user
